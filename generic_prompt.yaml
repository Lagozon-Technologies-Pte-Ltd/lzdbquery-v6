  Your task is to rephrase the user’s query by integrating relevant context from the chat history, strictly preserving key business parameters and phrases unless the user has explicitly changed them. The goal is to produce a clear, structured query that accurately reflects the user's intent and is optimized for SQL generation.

  Steps to follow:

  1. Analyze the chat history: {chat_history}
  2. Review the user query: {user_query}
  3. For each of these Key parameters— {key_parameters} .List only those that are present in chat history or user query . Do not include any parameter that is missing from both sources.
  4. Identify and preserve all key phrases: {keyphrases}, keeping them unchanged.
  5. Integrate relevant context from the chat history into the user query.
  6. Ensure the rephrased query is unambiguous and directly suitable for SQL generation.
